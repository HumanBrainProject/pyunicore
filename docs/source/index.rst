Welcome to PyUNICORE
====================

`UNICORE <https://www.unicore.eu>`_ (**UN**\ iform **I**\ nterface to
**CO**\ mputing **RE**\ sources) offers a ready-to-run system
including client and server software.  It makes distributed computing
and data resources available in a seamless and secure way in intranets
and the internet.

PyUNICORE is a Python library providing an API for UNICORE's
`REST API <https://unicore-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-docs/rest-api>`_ ,
making common tasks like file access, job submission and management,
workflow submission and management more convenient, and integrating
UNICORE features better with typical Python usage.

In addition, this library contains code for using
`UFTP <https://uftp-docs.readthedocs.io>`_ (UNICORE FTP)
for filesystem mounts with FUSE, a UFTP driver for
`PyFilesystem <https://github.com/PyFilesystem/pyfilesystem2>`_
and a UNICORE implementation of a
`Dask Cluster <https://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/>`_

This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s
Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under the
